<h1>This Is My Experience </h1>
<div style="float:right;"<p><b>GCSE</b></p></div>
<i>From Secondary School, I left with BTEC ICT for Business as well as Microsoft Skills</i>
<u>These skills allowed me to use excel, powerpoint, word as well as microsoft keys for bookkeeping and accounting, therefore giving me levarge in the marketplace over those without IT skills.</u>
<del>Continuing ICT in A Levels instead of Maths, Physics, Biology and Chemistry would have been wise but</del><b>No regrets</b>
<p><mark>The level of It proficiency later on in life, you realise you have, is far below the marketplace demand there for I advise all to <b>tech up an upgrade yourself to save yourself from recession succeeding the Ai influx the worldover</b>
<p>This is the <b>Main</b> reason why I am here on this course, as the game called <b><i>'Detroit:Become Human'</i></b> gives a reasonable depiction of the soft introduction of such Adroid Assistants who more or less are needed yet introduces gaps in the market espcially for workers in fields of care, hospitality and tourism, investigators, police, and receptionist as well as admins.</p>
